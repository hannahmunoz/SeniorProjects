# SeniorProjects
a backup of my senior projects files


To find the actual code files traverse through SeniorProjects/Freya-master/app/src/main/java/com/example/cil/freya
In MainActivity.java ctrl+f

GPSAccessPermission to find the function to ask for GPS permission

OnConnect to find out how to get the GPS location     

It looks like we might also need to know how to get mGoogleApiClient


In CreateNewDeployment.java ctrl+f 

case (R.id.installion_location) to find how to parse the GPS coordinates from the MainActivity
